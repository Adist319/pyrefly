# Python Typing for New Developers

*A beginner‑friendly guide to adding type hints in Python.*

**Note:** This tutorial assumes you understand some basic Python syntax, but are new to programming or type hints. To learn more about Python, see the [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) and [Getting Started Guide](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)

## 1. What is a Type Hint in Python?

A type hint in Python is a way to indicate the expected data type of a variable, function parameter, or return value. It's a hint to other developers (and to tools like type checkers and IDEs) about what type of data should be used with a particular piece of code.

Type hints are **not enforced at runtime by Python itself,** but they can be used by third-party tools (like Pyrefly) to catch type-related errors before your code runs. They also serve as documentation, making it easier for others to understand how to use your code.
Here's an example of a simple function with type hints:

```
def greet(name: str) -> None:
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

## 2. Why Bother with Type Hints?

Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you can write code without declaring types. However, this can lead to bugs or ambiguity in your code.

_TL;DR_
* Catch bugs **before** running the code.
* Improve editor autocomplete & refactors.
* Turn your code into living documentation.


<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="why_hints.py"
  codeSample={`# Without hints – is "times" a str, int, or list?
def repeat(text, times):
    return text * times

# With hints – intent is crystal clear.
def repeat(text: str, times: int) -> str:
    return text * times
`}
/>


### Can you spot the bug?

```
class Rectangle:
    width: int
    height: int

    def __init__(self, width: int, height: int) -> None:
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

rect = Rectangle(width=100, height=50)

area = rect.width * rect.hieght

print(area)
```


**Spelling is hard!** Let's add the `dataclass` decorator to our class definition. This will generate a constructor for us, and also add a few other useful methods.

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="misspelled.py"
  codeSample={`#Pyrefly will catch this spelling error before you run the code
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Rectangle:
    width: int
    height: int

rect = Rectangle(width=100, height=50)

area = rect.width * rect.hieght
`}
/>


## 3. Primitive Types

Since Python 3.9 you can use all the [primitive types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html) directly as annotations.

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="primitives_types.py"
  codeSample={`age: int = 30
height: float = 1.85
name: str = "Tyler Typer"
is_admin: bool = False
`}
/>

You can also specify a parameter as optional by using `Optional` type, or now with the `| None` syntax.

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="primitive2_types.py"
  codeSample={`# Optional typing example

from typing import Optional

middle_name: Optional[str] = None        # classic
nickname: str | None = None              # 3.10+ shorthand
`}
/>

## 4. Collections

### Syntax	Examples
- List of numbers	`list[int]	scores: list[int] = [98, 87, 91]`
- Tuple of two floats	`tuple[float, float]	point: tuple[float, float] = (3.0, 4.0)`
- Dict of str -> int	`dict[str, int]	inventory: dict[str, int] = {"apples": 5}`
- Set of strings	`set[str]	authors: set[str] = {"Bob", "Eve"}`

Since Python 3.9 you can subscript built‑ins directly—no need for `from typing import List`.

## 5. Functions
<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="basic_function_types.py"
  codeSample={`# Simple function
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
  `}
/>
Default values keep their annotation:

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="default_value_types.py"
  codeSample={`# Function with default value


def greet(name: str, polite: bool = True) -> str:
    return "Hello!" if polite else f"Yo {name}"
    `}
/>
Variable‑length arguments:

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="variable_length_types.py"
  codeSample={`# Variable length functions
from collections.abc import Callable

Logger = Callable[[str], None]

def debug(*msgs: str, log: Logger | None = print) -> None:
  for m in msgs:
    if log is not None:
      log(m)
    else:
      print(m)
    `}
/>

## 6. Get Type Hint Signals Directly in Your Editor

You can download the [Pyrefly extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.pyrefly) to get type hint signals directly in your IDE.

Next, install [Pyrefly](../installation/) and check some code:
```
# Fast, zero‑config
pip install pyrefly

pyrefly check ./my_sample.py

# Check whole directories
pyrefly check app/ tests/
```

Create a `pyrefly.toml` file to configure your project. Instructions [here](../configuration).
